## Subqueries, IN and ANY
<h3 align="left">✅ Subqueries </h3>
<p align="just"> A subquery is a feature within SQL that allows the creation of more optimized queries, reusing the result of a query within another query. </p>

We can use subqueries in 3 situations:
<div style="display: inline_block" align="left">

-  Within the WHERE clause, as a filter;
-  Within the SELECT clause, as a new column;
-  Within the FROM clause, as a new table.

<div style="display: inline_block" align="center">
