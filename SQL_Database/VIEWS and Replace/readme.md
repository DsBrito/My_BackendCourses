## VIEWS and Replace
<h3 align="left">✅ Views </h3>

<p align="just"> In SQL, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.
  A view contains rows and columns, just like a real table. The fields in a view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. 
  You can add SQL statements and functions to a view and present the data as if the data were coming from one single table. 
  A view is created with the CREATE VIEW statement. </p>
